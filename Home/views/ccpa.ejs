    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The CCPA is a new data privacy law that applies to businesses that collect personal information from California
        residents. The new law gives California residents new data privacy rights.
        <br /><br />
        OneUptime (Seven Summits Studio, Inc.) strongly believes that customers should be able to control their data and trust that
        their information is protected when stored with our service. To support this, OneUptime holds itself to strict data
        security and privacy standards, including compliance with the CCPA.
    </p>

    <h3> Readiness Report</h3>


    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, extends California consumers’ privacy rights by giving those
        consumers more control over their personal information.

        The CCPA takes effect on January 1, 2020, and OneUptime is on it.</p>

    <p> PROTECTING YOUR DATA</p>
    <p> OneUptime does not and will not buy or sell personal information. Our business is built on providing world-class
        monitoring, analytics, and on-call management for your resources and for your team; not on re-selling or
        enriching the data we collect.</p>

    <p> PROVIDING NEW RIGHTS & REQUESTS</p>
    <p> The CCPA gives California consumers new rights over their personal information. This includes the right to
        access personal information, the right to have personal information deleted, and the right to control the
        sale of personal information to third parties.</p>

    <p> MEETING CCPA REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSUMERS</p>
    <p> OneUptime’s API integrations allow you to meet consumers’ requests for access. Using our APIs, you can
        delete personal information, understand the categories of data collected, and get copies of the data
        OneUptime has processed on your behalf.</p>

    <p>HELPING YOU MEET YOUR COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS</p>
    <p>OneUptime is prepared and able to help you meet your CCPA compliance obligations. When you use
        OneUptime to collect or process personal information, OneUptime acts as a “service provider” and is
        prepared to sign a contractual addendum that cements our role.</p>

    <p>OPTION TO OPT-IN OR OUT</p>
    <p> OneUptime’s opt-in/opt-out features allow you to meet your privacy obligations by not tracking or
        collecting information from users who have opted out of tracking or collection.</p>

    <p> CUSTOM DATA COLLECTION</p>
    <p> OneUptime’s implementation features allow you to customize the data you collect from your
        users so you can limit the amount of personal information you collect (or not collect any at
        all). </p>

    <p> STRONG ENCRYPTION</p>
    <p>OneUptime applies cryptographic controls across its platform to protect personal
        information. OneUptime encrypts data it collects both in transit and at rest using strong
        encryption algorithms.</p>

    <p>ONEUPTIME HAS A TEAM OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROFESSIONALS DEDICATED TO OUR COMPLIANCE AND
        TO HELPING YOU MAINTAIN YOUR COMPLIANCE AND CONFIDENCE WHEN USING ONEUPTIME.</p>

    <p>Definitions</p>
    <p>“CCPA” means the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as set forth in California Civil
        Code § 1798.100 et seq. and all other applicable laws or regulations relating to the
        Processing of Personal Information that may exist in the relevant jurisdiction.

        exchanged or shared pursuant to the Agreement.</p>
    <p>The subject-matter of the Processing of Personal Information covered by this CDPA is

    <p>In respect of Personal Information Processed in the course of providing the
        Application Services, OneUptime:</p>
    <p>shall Process Personal Information only in accordance with the documented
        instructions from Customer (as set out in this CDPA or the Agreement or as otherwise
        notified by Customer to OneUptime from time to time); provided OneUptime may Process
        Personal Information for Business Purposes under the CCPA or another applicable law
        or regulation, and in such cases OneUptime will inform Customer of such requirement
        prior to the Processing unless that law prohibits this on important grounds of
        public interest;</p>
    <p>may hire other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, provided that
        OneUptime complies with the provisions of this clause. Any such subcontractors will
        be permitted to Process Personal Information only to deliver the Services. OneUptime
        remains responsible for its subcontractors’ compliance with the obligations of this
        CDPA, and OneUptime shall ensure that any subcontractors to whom OneUptime transfers
        Personal Information will have entered into written agreements with OneUptime
        requiring that the subcontractor abide by terms substantially similar to this CDPA;
        and</p>
    <p>shall reasonably assist the Customer with its obligation to respond to requests from
        Consumers under the CCPA (including requests for information relating to the
        Processing, and requests relating to access, rectification, erasure or portability
        of the Personal Information) provided that OneUptime reserves the right to
        reimbursement from Customer for the reasonable cost of any time, expenditures or
        fees incurred in connection with such assistance.</p>
    <p>Miscellaneous</p>
    <p>Except as expressly provided in this CDPA, the parties intend no amendment or

    <p>Any notice to be provided under this CDPA to Customer shall be sent via
        email to the email address associated with Customer’s account.
        This CDPA supplements the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any
        conflict between this CDPA and the Agreement regarding the processing of
        Consumers’ Personal Information, the terms of this CDPA shall control.</p>
    <p>If any provision of this CDPA is held by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be contrary to the law, the provision shall be modified
        by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of
        the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the
        remaining provisions of this CDPA shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>No waiver under this CDPA will be valid or binding unless set forth in
        writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of such
        waiver is sought. Any such waiver will constitute a waiver only with
        respect to the specific matter described therein and will in no way
        impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect
        or at any other time. Any delay or forbearance by either party in
