    <h3>Our Commitment to GDPR</h3>
    <p>On May 25, 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect. GDPR regulates the
        governance
        of personal data for EU citizens with an emphasis on data security and privacy. The GDPR does not only apply to
        companies
        that operate in the EU. This regulation will also impact companies operating outside of the EU if they have any
        EU
        customers or personal data of anyone in the EU.
    </p>
    <p>Seven Summits Studio, Inc. has made information security and data privacy foundational principles of everything we do, and
        we recognize
        the importance of passing regulations to advance information security and data privacy for citizens of the EU.

        are firmly committed to GDPR readiness.
