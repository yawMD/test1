    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>In the not too distant past, when on-premises software was the norm, data storage was simple. Your data lived
        with
        you. Today, cloud services make data residency more complicated. Global organizations are creating their own
        internal policies for where data can be stored, while governments and third-party regulators are enforcing data
        residency requirements.</p>

    <p>Thousands of companies use OneUptime every day, but because data is primarily stored in the United States, many
        organizations abroad remain on the sidelines. To bridge this gap—and make OneUptime available to more organizations
        in highly regulated
        sectors, such as financial services, government and health care—we’re delivering data residency for OneUptime. </p>

    <p>Data residency will give global organizations more control over where their data is stored. We can deploy your
        data to any of the Microsoft Azure, Aamazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform, or On-Prem regions around the
        world.

    <h3>Data residency FAQ: What you need to know</h3>


    <h5>With data residency, what type of data does OneUptime store?</h5>
    <p>Data from OneUptime is stored at rest within a desired data
        region. All data in OneUptime, whether in transit or at rest, is encrypted.</p>

    <h5>Where does third party data reside data reside?</h5>
    <p>The location of data from third-party apps your organization use with OneUptime is dependent on the
        application partner’s policies.</p>

    <h5>I’m an existing customer. Can I move my data to a new region?</h5>
    <p>Yes! Existing customers can move their organization’s or projects data to new residency regions. Note, however,
        that
        the entire organization must be rooted in a single region.</p>

    <h5>If I move my data to a new region, will anything else change?</h5>
    <p>No. Your organization will enjoy the same OneUptime experience and features they use today.</p>
