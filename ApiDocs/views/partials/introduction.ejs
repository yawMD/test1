      <p>
        The OneUptime API is organized around the <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> framework.
        Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate
        API errors. We use built-in HTTP features like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which can be understood
        by off-the-shelf HTTP clients, and we support <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">cross-origin resource sharing</a>
        to allow you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application/mobile application,
        or any service that can consume HTTP RESTful API's.
        You should remember that you should never expose your API Key in any public website's client-side code, Project
        ID however can be exposed).
        <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors
        (though if you're using API bindings/SDK,
        we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).
